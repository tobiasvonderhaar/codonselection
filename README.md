This repository contains Raw Data and analysis scripts for our 2018  manuscript "Experimental determination of codon usage-dependent selective pressure on high copy-number genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae" (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/29/358259">Joss&eacute; <i>et al.</i> 2018</a>).
Analysis scripts are provided in Jupyter Notebook format. These can be viewed as static html files by clicking on the Github link, or they can be downloaded for interactive execution with locally installed Jupyter Notebook software.
